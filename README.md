# c-calculator

This project for uni that is a calculator made in c++ but it only uses + and - operators. 

## Multiplication
To multiply is to add a number by itself a certain amount of times

example
10 * 2 is 
10 + 10 = 20

## Division
To divide is to subtract one number against another until the remainder is smaller the the divisor

example
64 - 12 = 52

52 - 12 = 40

40 - 12 = 28

28 - 12 = 16

16 - 12 = 4 

the quotient is the amount of times it took to subtract and the remainder is the result of the last subtraction
so in this case its 5 with a remainder of 4

## Power
To perfom operations like 2^4 it is a multiplication 

so 2^4 which is essentially

2+2 = 4
4+4 = 8
8+8 = 16
16 + 16 = 32

## Factorial
To perform a factorial the concept is pretty simple, take !4 
we can break this down into 4x3x2x1 = 24
Since we did the multiplication before all we have to do is multiply the initial number
by itself -1, then take that total and multiply it by the number and subtract -1 again from it to do the multiplication again
and repeat until the number is 1. 

example

4 x (4-1) = 12
12 x (3-1) = 24
24 x (2-1) = 24

# c-calculator

This project for uni that is a calculator made in c++ but it only uses + and - operators. 

## Multiplication
To multiply is to add a number by itself a certain amount of times

example
10 * 2 is 
10 + 10 = 20

## Division
To divide is to subtract one number against another until the remainder is smaller the the divisor

example
64 - 12 = 52

52 - 12 = 40

40 - 12 = 28

28 - 12 = 16

16 - 12 = 4 

the quotient is the amount of times it took to subtract and the remainder is the result of the last subtraction
so in this case its 5 with a remainder of 4
